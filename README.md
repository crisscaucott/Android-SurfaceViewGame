#SurfaceViewGame
============

The game is try to find the Android logo dragging their finger on the screen to move the "flashlight". When the flashlight (white circle) intersects with the hidden Android logo, the screen lights up to reveal the complete image and show the "win" message.
The black screen, flashlight and the Android logo are drawn by canvas on a SurfaceView.
